A music curator

# Client Info
Client authentication through spotify is needed to use this curator. It is contained in the file specified in the curate.js route. The format is [client id]:[client secret], not including brackets. Please note the colon in between the two, and ensure that these are all on one line, and are the only thing in the client information file. There is an example file with old data in it for reference.
