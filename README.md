A music curator

# Client Info
Client authentication through spotify is needed to use this curator. It is contained in the client_info.txt file in the root directory. The format is [client id]:[client secret]. Please note the colon in between the two, and ensure that these are all on one line, and are the only thing in the client_info file. There is an example file with old data in it for reference.
